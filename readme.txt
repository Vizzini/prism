The following are known issues for this 1st Community Drop.  Please note some items are still under construction.

Item TBD: Acceptance tests won't run without White.

Acceptance Tests are included in the StockTraderRI_AcceptanceTests.sln, but they are dependent
on Thoughtworks' "White" UI Automation tool set.  

The White project can be found here : http://www.codeplex.com/white
